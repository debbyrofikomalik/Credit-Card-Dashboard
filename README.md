# Project 3: Credit Card Customer Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Credit Card Customer Dashboard**, developed to analyze customer demographics, transaction behavior, revenue generation, and risk exposure for a U.S.-based credit card company. The analysis and visualization were conducted using **Google Looker Studio**, built from scratch with data sourced from a **private dataset** obtained through the **MySkill Data Science & Analysis training program**.

The dashboard demonstrates end-to-end analytics capability from connecting, cleaning, and structuring data in Google Sheets to designing a dynamic, insight-driven visualization in Looker Studio.

## Key Insights

### Customer Demographics

The customer base is predominantly concentrated in **California, Texas, and New York**, indicating that marketing and retention strategies should prioritize these high-value states due to their strong contribution to overall revenue.  

Across occupations, **self-employed individuals** form the largest segment, highlighting a customer base composed largely of business owners, freelancers, and independent professionals. This group tends to have variable income but higher spending potential, making it both profitable and moderately risky in terms of credit stability.  

Educationally, the majority of customers hold **graduate-level degrees**, reflecting a financially literate audience likely to understand complex credit products and respond positively to advanced reward programs or value-added financial services.

### Revenue Profile

From a profitability standpoint, **businessmen** emerge as the primary revenue drivers. They exhibit high transaction volumes and frequent credit utilization, translating into substantial **interest income** for the company. However, their high revolving balances also warrant close monitoring due to elevated exposure to credit risk.  

The **self-employed** group contributes significantly through **annual fees**, despite lower overall transaction volumes. This pattern suggests a segment that values premium credit cards for their perks and convenience while maintaining disciplined repayment behavior â€” an attractive mix of stability and profitability.  

Spending analysis shows that most customers allocate expenses toward **bills, fuel, and groceries**, representing **non-discretionary, recurring expenses**. This indicates strong opportunities for targeted rewards, cashback programs, and partnerships with essential service providers to drive loyalty and continuous card usage.  

---

### Risk Profile

Risk segmentation highlights several critical insights. **Government employees without formal education** show the **highest delinquency rates (â‰ˆ0.14)**, indicating potential income instability or limited financial literacy. These customers should be managed with **stricter credit approval criteria**, **smaller initial credit limits**, and **early payment reminders** to minimize default risk.  

**Retirees** exhibit **high utilization ratios**, often nearing their credit limits. While they may have reliable repayment histories, this trend suggests liquidity constraints or reliance on credit for daily needs. Continuous monitoring and financial education initiatives focused on debt management are recommended for this group.  

In contrast, **white-collar professionals** consistently demonstrate **low delinquency rates** and balanced utilization levels. This segment presents a strong opportunity for **cross-selling premium financial products** such as travel cards, credit limit upgrades, or personal loans, helping maximize **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** while maintaining low risk exposure.

## Business Recommendations

1. **Revenue Optimization**  
   Offer premium benefits and loyalty programs tailored to **self-employed and businessman** segments to strengthen long-term engagement and encourage higher credit utilization. These segments demonstrate strong profitability potential through interest income and annual fees, making them ideal candidates for exclusive rewards, cashback incentives, or priority customer programs.  

   Develop targeted **rewards initiatives** focused on essential spending categories such as **bills, fuel, and groceries**, which represent the majority of transactions. This approach can enhance everyday card usage and build consistent revenue streams from non-discretionary spending patterns.

2. **Risk Mitigation**  
   Establish **proactive credit monitoring systems** in states with elevated delinquency levels, particularly **Oregon** and **Pennsylvania**. Early detection mechanisms, such as credit utilization alerts and predictive scoring, can help identify customers at risk of default before delinquency occurs.  

   Strengthen preventive measures for **government employees** and **retirees** who exhibit higher utilization ratios. This includes implementing stricter underwriting standards, providing early repayment reminders, and offering structured financial education programs to promote responsible credit management and reduce default exposure.

3. **Marketing Strategy**  
   Personalize marketing initiatives according to customer lifestyle and relationship status. For **married customers**, focus on family-oriented offers such as travel bundles, household purchase rewards, or education financing benefits. For **single customers**, emphasize lifestyle-oriented perks including entertainment, dining, or solo travel rewards to increase relevance and appeal.  

   Prioritize customer retention and acquisition campaigns in high-value markets such as **California, Texas, and New York**, where the concentration of profitable customers is highest. Implement region-specific marketing strategies and localized offers to enhance engagement and maximize overall portfolio performance.

## Results and Impact

The dashboard provides an integrated view of customer profitability, spending trends, and credit risk, allowing stakeholders to make data-informed decisions about marketing, credit allocation, and customer relationship management. By combining demographic, transactional, and risk data, the project demonstrates how analytics can directly inform strategic actions in the financial sector.
